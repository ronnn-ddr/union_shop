### Terminology
**Hardcoded data*** = Data that is written directly into your Flutter code. These are fixed values rather than data loaded from external sources like APIs, databases, or other services.

**Dummy data** = Data that is often hardcoded or (AI) generated for display or testing purposes. It's not meant to represent real-world data stored in your services.

**Responsive** = Design that adapts to different screen sizes for example different layouts on mobile and desktop targets. For the purpose of this coursework, you are primarily developing a web application on mobile view.
